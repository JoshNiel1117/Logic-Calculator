# Logic-Calculator
Repository for the program I made for Truth Logic Calculator

Use this tool to know the resulting truth value of a compound statement. For example, if a statement is True AND the second statement is True, the resulting value would be True.

To use, just run/open the Logic Calculator.exe (Application)

For future updates:
- Generate a truth table for a specific formula
